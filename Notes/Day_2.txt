Day 2
* Command line arguements - passing data to the main method in java(during at execution)
  - array of values in string format
  - We cannot pass Integer data but we can recieve them in string format and convert it into integer.
  - To find Length of arguemts passed we can use "args.length();"
* Good Programming Practices
  - Naming Conventions(ClassNames[nouns&starting letter capital], 
                      variable Names[mixedcase with lowercase, can have _,no.s with specific meaning], 
                      Method names[mixedcase with nextword Capital])
                     
  - Comments ( Block Comments at the top of classes or interfaces,Single Comments can used anywhere )
  - Number per Line 
             int h,c;  X X
             int h; int c; _/_/ 
  - Do not put different types on same line( int h,a[]; )


               **********Afternoon Session**********

* Java API(in C header files/libraries can be called as API's)
 - framework of Java, is a collection of prewritten methods
 - Refer Documention - Oracle JAVA SE
